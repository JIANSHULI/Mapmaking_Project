Running Faceted Mapmaking...

Now loading all the baseline vectors.
[NOTE: THIS ASSUMES THAT THE DATA FORMAT IS SOUTH EAST UP, THOUGH THE INTERNAL FORMAT IS EAST NORTH UP (RIGHT HANDED SYSTEM)]
Now loading array's principal axes...[NOTE: THESE ARE HARD CODED TO AN ARBITARY (SMALL) VALUE OR 0 FOR NOW.]
Now loading all visibilities for 150.195 MHz and yy polarization...

Now loading and computing the noise variance on each visibility...[NOTE: NOISE SET TO A SIMPLISTIC MODEL FOR NOW.]
Now loading all the primary beam pointings...
Now loading the primary beams for the nearest two frequencies and interpolating/extrapolating between them...
[NOTE: FOR NOW, PRIMARY BEAM IS ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL OBSERVATIONS]
Now computing the horizontal angle to the facet center for all LSTs...
559 of the 8641 total integrations have the facet center within 10 degrees of the primary beam center.
These integrations have been grouped into 47 snapshots of at most 120 seconds.
Now multiplying all visibilities by the inverse noise variance...[NOTE: FOR NOW, EACH VISIBILITY HAS A NOISE VARIANCE OF 1]
Now rephasing all visibilities to the facet center...
[NOTE: DESPITE WHAT I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, THE SIGN ON THE TRANSLATION SEEMS TO BE POSITIVE NOT NEGATIVE. THIS WARRENTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.]
Now converting the visibilities to temperature units...
Now figuring out the full size of the facet for all snapshots...
Now calculating all snapshot maps...
